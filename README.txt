Runs on port 8000.]
Game only runs with four people, anymore that join will be taken to the waiting on players screen and will never play.

----ISSUES----
Map and textures are misaligned in certain areas. I changed how i drew the map and didnt have time to fix it.
Spritesheets dont seem to work on the server, they work fine if you close the server.
Character changes direction based on other players, i have no idea what causes this.
Divs dont disappear after the game is finished.
I could not get the indicator to work (unfortunately). To remedy this i put the x and y postions of everyone in the hud, its quite to read but it works.
The only sound effect is you shooting. 
Disconnecting does not change the id's of characters to allow other player to play, it just breaks until server restart.
